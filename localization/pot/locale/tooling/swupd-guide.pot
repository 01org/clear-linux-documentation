msgid ":command:`swupd` manages overlapping dependencies behind the scenes, ensuring that all software is compatible across the system. It can be used to verify the OS, clean cached files, and fix issues."

#: ../../../source/tooling/swupd-guide.rst:26
msgid ":ref:`Bundles <bundles>` contain everything needed to deliver a software capability. They are the smallest granularity component that is managed by |CL|. A bundle comes with all of its dependencies rather than downloading a cascade of package dependencies when installing a piece of software."

msgid "Using package managers to monitor software version compatibility or compare multiple systems on many Linux distributions can be cumbersome."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/tooling/swupd-guide.rst:38
msgid "With |CL| :command:`swupd`, versioning happens at the individual file level. This means |CL| generates an entirely new OS version with any set of software changes to the system, including software downgrades or removals. This rolling release versioning model is similar to :command:`git` internal version tracking, where any of the individual file commits are tracked and move the pointer forward when changed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/tooling/swupd-guide.rst:45
msgid "A number that represents the **current** release of the OS describes the versions of all the software on the OS. Each build is composed of a specific set of bundles made from a particular version of packages. On a daily basis, this matters to system administrators who need to determine which of their systems do not have the latest security fixes, or which combinations of software have been tested. Every release of the same number is guaranteed to contain the same versions of software, so there's no ambiguity between two systems running the same version of |CL|."

msgid "|CL| enforces regular updating of the OS by default and automatically checks for updates against a version server. The content server provides the file and metadata content for all versions and can be the same as the version server. The content url server provides metadata in the form of *manifests*, which list and describe file contents, symlinks, and directories. Additionally, the actual content is provided to clients in the form of archive files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/tooling/swupd-guide.rst:65
msgid "Software updates with |CL| are also efficient. Unlike package-based distributions, :command:`swupd` only updates files that have changed, rather than entire packages. For example, it is quite common for an OS security patch to be as small as 15 KB. Using binary deltas, |CL| is able to apply only what is needed."
