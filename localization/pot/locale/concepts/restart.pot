msgid "Restart system services after an OS update"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/concepts/restart.rst:6
msgid "The software life cycle describes how software is created, developed, and deployed, and includes how to replace or update software. A good OS provides tools for the entire software life cycle. These tools must include ways to remove software components properly when replaced with something else."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/concepts/restart.rst:12
msgid "Most of the work on software update code in |CL| was focused on adding new software to the system. We recommended that users reboot their system once in a while, but we did not provide any tools to restart services easily, until now."

msgid "User challenges"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/concepts/restart.rst:20
msgid "It is difficult to determine which services to restart. You can either evaluate each system and reboot manually, or figure out which services to restart based on documentation like the |CL| release notes. Since neither option solves the issue completely, the |CL| team created a solution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/concepts/restart.rst:25
msgid "Over the years, several OSes approached the problem and created partial solutions such as the following:"

msgid "Ask the user to restart the OS."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/concepts/restart.rst:35
msgid "Both solutions are acceptable for many OSes. However, |CL| updates software automatically and users do not see notices from the updater unless they review the journal. |CL| requires a completely different solution, with the following requirements:"

msgid "Eliminate the guesswork about what to restart and under what circumstances."

msgid "Our method restarts daemons when it is really needed, especially in the case of security updates. The tool restarts daemons by reading various files in the :file:`procfs` filesystem provided by the kernel."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/concepts/restart.rst:57
msgid "The second part of the problem is to determine whether or not running processes are part of a system service. The tool focuses on system services because most system services are background tasks with no direct user interaction. Fortunately, :command:`systemd` provides a simple way to:"

msgid "Figure 1: Invoke :command:`clr-service-restart`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/concepts/restart.rst:83
msgid ":command:`clr-service-restart` implements a whitelist to identify which daemons can be restarted. The system administrator can customize the default |CL| OS whitelist using *allow* or *disallow* options for restarting system services. When a software update occurs, :command:`clr-service-restart` consults the whitelist to see if a service daemon is allowed to be restarted or not. See the options section for details."
