msgid "``autospec`` is a tool to assist in the automated creation and maintenance of RPM packaging in |CL-ATTR|. Where a standard RPM build process using ``rpmbuild`` requires a tarball and .spec file to start, ``autospec`` requires only a tarball and package name to start."

msgid "How autospec works"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/concepts/autospec-about.rst:14
msgid "``autospec`` attempts to infer the requirements of the .spec file by analyzing the source code and :file:`Makefile` information. It will continuously run updated builds based on new information discovered from build failures until it has a complete and valid .spec file. Although not required, you can influence the behavior of ``autospec`` by providing :ref:`control files <control-files>`."

msgid "The basic process is described in the following steps:"

#: ../../../source/concepts/autospec-about.rst:34
msgid "If ``autospec`` detects the root cause and knows how to continue, it will restart the build automatically at step 1 with updated build instructions."

#: ../../../source/concepts/autospec-about.rst:37
msgid "Otherwise, ``autospec`` will stop the build for user inspection and editing of control files to resolve the errors. The user resumes the process at step 1 after errors are resolved."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/concepts/autospec-about.rst:40
msgid "Following these steps, ``autospec`` continues to rebuild the package, based on new information discovered from build failures, until it has a valid .spec. If no build errors occur, RPM packages are successfully built."
