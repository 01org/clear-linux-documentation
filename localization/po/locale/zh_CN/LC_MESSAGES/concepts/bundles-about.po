"Linux-based operating systems contain the code of several hundred, if not"
" thousands, of open source projects. To make this manageable, "
"distributions use a concept called \"packages\" to configure and compile "
"the source code of these projects into binaries."

"Many distributions then split the content of these compiled packages into"
" so-called sub-packages, which are the granularity at which these "
"distributions deploy their software. With those kinds of distributions, "
"system administrators can then install and update sub-packages "
"individually or as a set, using tools such as \"yum\" and \"apt-get.\""

"The |CL-ATTR| takes a slightly different approach. While we also use the "
"concept of packages to manage compiling source code into binaries, we do "
"not use the package concept to deploy software. Instead, we provide "
"software \"bundles\" that are installed and managed using :ref:`swupd"
"<swupd-about>`. Each bundle contains as many or as few open source "
"projects needed to provide a complete functionality."
