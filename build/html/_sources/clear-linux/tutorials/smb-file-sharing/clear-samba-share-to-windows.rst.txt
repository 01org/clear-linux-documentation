Enabling simple file sharing from Clear Linux to a Windows machine using Samba
##############################################################################

This guide will cover the steps you need to do to enable simple file sharing 
from |CLOSIA| to Windows. For more advanced sharing please refer to the 
`Samba guide`_  

#.	Follow the :ref:`install-on-target` guide to install |CL|.
#.	After |CL| is setup then add the storage-utils bundle which 
	includes the Samba binaries. The os-clr-on-clr bundle also includes this.

	.. code-block:: console
		
		$sudo swupd bundle-add storage-utils

#.	Create a configuration file at :file:`/etc/samba/smb.conf` and add the following 
	but change as needed. The config below has two simple examples of sharing 
	a folder to a specific user and sharing a folder to anyone. This 
	method assumes that a user account named "clearlinuxuser" already exists.  
	If a valid users is not specified below then anyone with a user account 	
	on this machine with their Samba password already set will be able to 
	access the files.  However, that account will only be able to access files 
	and folders that it has permission 	to on the system.  Use :command:`chown`
	or :command:`chmod` to change either the owner of the file or the 
	permissions to allow other users to access.  

	.. code-block:: console

		[Global]
		map to guest = bad user

		[Downloads]
		path=/home/clearlinuxuser/Downloads
		read only = no
		guest ok = no
		valid users = clearlinuxuser
		
		[Documents]
		path=/home/clearlinuxuser/Documents
		read only = no
		browsable = yes
		guest ok = yes

#.	As root user, enable the Samba daemon so that it starts every time.

	.. code-block:: console

		# systemctl enable smb
		# systemctl start smb
	
#.	Samba maintains its own list of passwords for user accounts and that can 
	be different than the password to log in. As root user, use :command:`smbpasswd`
	to add the initial password for the user account that will access the share. 

	.. code-block:: console

		# smbpasswd -a clearlinuxuser

#. 	At this point a Windows machine on the same network should be able to 
	access the shares. Windows uses the format `\\\\[server IP or hostname]\\folder`
	to access shares. This can be done directly from Windows Explorer or the 
	drive can be mapped to a letter in Windows.  It is easiest to use the IP 
	address of the machine to access it. However, using the hostname of the 
	|CL| machine will work if it is behind an Active Directory domain 
	controller or behind a DNS server. For other ways to access the shares 
	using a hostname instead of an IP address consult `Chapter 7 of the Samba guide`_. 

Mapping |CL| drive in Windows
*****************************

#.	Open up Windows Explorer and click on the left sidebar on :guilabel:`This PC`
	to change the options available at the top. 
#.	Choose the :guilabel:`Map network drive` icon and put 
	in the path as `\\\\[server IP or hostname]\\[shared folder]`. 
#.	Check the box :guilabel:`Connect Using Different Credentials` to put in the Samba 
	user defined above "clearlinuxuser" and the password created with 
	:command:`smbpasswd`. See Figure 1 and Figure 2.
