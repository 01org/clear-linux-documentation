Using VirtualBox
################

This section explains how to run Clear Linux OS for IntelÂ® Architecture
inside a `VirtualBox`_\* environment.

Download VirtualBox
===================

VirtualBox is a hypervisor supported by Oracle. You can
download it from the `official VirtualBox website`_ and select
the operating system you are using.

Download **version 5.0 or greater** to ensure support for
the :abbr:`AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions)` needed to run
Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture.


Create a virtual machine in VirtualBox
======================================

#. Download the `latest`_ live version (clear-XXXX-live.img.xz)
   from https://download.clearlinux.org/image/.

#. Decompress the downloaded image. Uncompressed image size is ~ **5GB**.

   - On Linux ::

       $ xz -d clear-XXXX-live.img.xz

   - On Windows you can use `7zip`_.

#. To convert a raw image to :abbr:`VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)`
   format, you can use one of the following commands::

      $ VBoxManage convertfromraw clear-XXXX-live.img clear-XXXX-live.vdi --format VDI

   or::

      $ vbox-img convert --srcfilename clear-XXXX-live.img --dstfilename clear-XXXX-live.vdi --srcformat raw --dstformat vdi


   Note: Be sure you have Virtual box directory in your PATH (i.e.: on Windows
   :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox`).

#. Create a virtual machine using the VirtualBox assistant:

   * Type: **Linux**
   * Version: **Linux 2.6 / 3.x / 4.x (64-bit)**
   * Attach the virtual disk created in the step number 3 as virtual hard disk file

#. After it is created, go to settings to enable **EFI support**

   * System -> Enable EFI (special OSes only)


Run your new VM
===============

Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture supports VirtualBox kernel modules used
by the Linux kernel 4.4 :abbr:`LTS (Long Term Support)` (*kernel-lts bundle*).
This kernel was selected because Clear Linux OS's main kernel
(``kernel-native``) bundle keeps up-to-date with the upstream Linux kernel, 
and sometimes VirtualBox kernel modules aren't compatible with pre-kernel
releases.

In the first boot, Clear Linux will ask for a login user, type **root** and
then the system will ask you for a new password.

To install the VirtualBox kernel modules, here are the steps:

#. Install the bundle that supports VirtualBox modules::

     # swupd bundle-add kernel-lts

#. Set a timeout in the bootmanager to shows a menu at boot time::

     # clr-boot-manager set-timeout 10

#. Update the bootloader entries with::

     # clr-boot-manager update

#. Reboot your system with::

     # reboot

   and choose LTS kernel version.

#. (*Optional*) Unset timeout to boot directly to LTS version::

     # clr-boot-manager set-timeout 0

#. (*Mandatory*) Update bootmanger to use always LTS version::

     # clr-boot-manager update


Install Guest Additions
-----------------------

The kernel modules are shipped with the ``kernel-lts`` bundle; however,
you'll need to install the *user* Linux Guest Additions. To install the 
VirtualBox Guest Additions, follow these steps:

#. Insert Guest Additions CD image using *Devices* menu

#. Install Linux users Guest Additions::

     # install-vbox-lga

#. Reboot your system::

     # reboot

#. (*Optional*) To use Clear Linux graphical user interface, add the GUI bundle::

     # swupd bundle-add os-utils-gui

   once the ``os-utils-gui`` bundle is installed, start your graphical 
   user interface with::

     # startx

   Clear Linux doesn't provide a graphical display manager.
