Clear Linux* OS on Microsoft* Azure*
====================================

Clear Linux OS is now an offering in the Azure Marketplace.

Clear Linux OS is designed with cloud and data center environments in mind
and is tuned to maximize the performance and value of IntelÂ® architecture.
In Azure our boot times are lightning-quick, with all on-boot services
launched in less than a second on nodes with warm caches [1]_.

There are three offerings of Clear Linux OS within the Azure Marketplace. They can
be created through the `Azure Portal <https://portal.azure.com>`_ or by
using the `Azure Command Line tools <https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli>`_.
Each offering can be further customized by using the swupd command to install
additional bundles. Learn more about Clear Linux OS and bundles
at https://clearlinux.org/documentation.
