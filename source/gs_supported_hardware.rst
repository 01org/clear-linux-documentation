If you're unsure, you can determine ahead of time whether your system will be
capable of running the Clear Linux* OS for Intel® Architecture by downloading
and running the simple `clear-linux-check-config.sh`_ script locally. This script
is available in the `current`_ download directory; it checks the hardware
capabilities of your system to determine whether it will work with the
latest current release.

For developers who are already familiar with the hardware capabilities of their
system(s), the following processors have been tested to be successful
in running Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture:

-  4th Generation Intel® Core™ processor family on the system of your choice.
-  5th Generation Intel® Core™ processor family on the system of your choice.
-  Intel® Xeon® Processor E5 v3 processor family on the server of your choice.
-  Intel® Xeon® Processor E3 v5 processor family on the server of your choice.
