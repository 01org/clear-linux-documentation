Installing the OS as host
##########################################################

Running Clear Linux* OS for IntelÂ® Architecture natively on a system is easy 
with the simple installer image. To get started you'll need the following:

* A USB stick flashed with the `installer image <http://download.clearlinux.org/image/>`_. 
  For instructions on how to do this, see :ref:`gs_creating_bootable_usb`.
* Host machine running :ref:`gs_supported_hardware`.
* Network access via DHCP.

Installing Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture to a target system
===================================================================

1. Configure the BIOS; this may involve changing the boot device order 
   to boot first from the USB device. 
2. Insert the USB device that is flashed with the 
   `installer image <http://download.clearlinux.org/image/>`_ into the 
   target system, then reboot. As the system boots, you'll see::

	Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture installation in progress... Your 
	computer will power off once installation completes successfully.

The entire installation should take no more than a few minutes. If you run into 
any trouble, log in as root during the installation phase and check the status 
of the install with::

	$ systemctl status ister

You might need to switch to another TTY.
