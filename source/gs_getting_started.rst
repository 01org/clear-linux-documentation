Getting started with Clear Linux* OS for IntelÂ® Architecture
############################################################

The easiest way to give Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture a spin is to download a
recent KVM image from the `image directory <http://download.clearlinux.org/image/>`_
on our download page. This directory contains a current image, the UEFI firmware
helper and the KVM start helper script. See :ref:`gs_running_clr_virtual` for details.

You can also try :ref:`gs_installing_clr_as_host` on a target computer.
