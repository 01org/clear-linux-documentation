Use VMware\* Workstation Player
###############################

This section explains how to run |CLOSIA| as a virtual machine using the 
`VMware Workstation 14 Player`_ hypervisor.

There are 2 ways to create a |CL| VM to run in VMware:

* `Method #1`: Fresh installation of |CL| into new VM.  This provides flexibility 
  in configuring the VM size, partitions, initial |CL| bundles selection, etc.
* `Method #2`: Use a ready-made VMware |CL| image with minimally required bundles.  

Both are discussed below.  

.. note::

  The figures shown throughout this document are from the Windows version of 
  VMware Workstation 14 Player.  They are applicable for the Linux version as
  well (with minor differences).


Install the VMware Workstation Player hypervisor
================================================

#.  Enable `Intel速 Virtualization Technology
    <http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/virtualization/virtualization-technology/intel-virtualization-technology.html>`_
    (Intel速 VT) and `Intel速 Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O
    <https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-virtualization-technology-for-directed-io-vt-d-enhancing-intel-platforms-for-efficient-virtualization-of-io-devices>`_
    (Intel速 VT-d) on the host system's BIOS/UEFI firmware configuration.
#.  VMware Workstation 14 Player is available for Windows and Linux.  Download 
    the preferred version of choice.
#.  Install it.

    * For Linux distros: 

      #.  Enable a GUI desktop.  
      #.  Start a terminal emulator.
      #.  Start the installer and follow the guided steps.

        .. code-block:: console

          $ sudo sh ./VMware-Player-<version>.x86_64.bundle

    * For Windows:

      #.  Start the installer and follow the Setup Wizard.

For additional help, see the `VMware Workstation Player guide`_.

Download the latest |CL| image
==============================

Go to the |CL| `image`_ repository and download the desired type:

* ISO installer image: `clear-<version>-installer.iso.xz` (for Method 1)
* VMware image: `clear-<version>-vmware.vmdk.xz` (for Method 2)

For older versions, see the `releases`_ page.

Although not required, it is recommended to download the corresponding 
checksum file (designated with `-SHA512SUMS` at the end of the filename) 
for the image in order to verify its integrity.

Verify the integrity of the download (recommended)
==================================================

* For Linux distros:

  #.  Start a terminal emulator.
  #.  Go to the directory with the downloaded files.
  #.  To verify the integrity of the image, enter the following (an installer ISO
      image is used as an example):

      .. code-block:: console

        $ sha512sum ./clear-<version>-installer.iso.xz | diff ./clear-<version>-installer.iso.xz-SHA512SUMS -

      If the checksum of the downloaded image is different than the original
      checksum, the differences will displayed. An empty output indicates a match.

* For Windows:

  #.  Start Command-Prompt.
  #.  Go to the directory with the downloaded files.
  #.  To verify the integrity of the image, enter the following commands:

      .. code-block:: console

        C:\> CertUtil -hashfile ./clear-<version>-installer.iso.xz | findstr -v file

      Compare the output with the original checksum to make sure they match.

Uncompress the image
====================

* For Linux distros (an installer ISO image is used as an example):

  .. code-block:: console

    $ unxz clear-<version>-installer.iso.xz

* For Windows:

  Use `7zip`_ to uncompress it.

Method 1: Fresh installation of |CL| into a new VM 
==================================================

The general process for performing a fresh installation of |CL| into a new VM 
is as follows (with expanded details below):

* Create a new VM and configure its settings
* Attach the installer ISO to it
* Install |CL|
* Detach the installer ISO
* Power off the VM
* Enable EFI boot support
* Power on the VM
