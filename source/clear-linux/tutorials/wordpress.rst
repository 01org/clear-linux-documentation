WordPress\* use case tutorial
#############################

Welcome to our WordPress use case tutorial. The objective of the tutorial is
to guide you to a fully realized WordPress website using |CLOSIA|.

In this tutorial we assume your system is already running |CL|. For
instructions on how to install |CL| on bare metal, see the
`bare metal install`_ page from our `getting started`_ guide.
For your convenience, we have split this tutorial in two different
sections.  If you already have a |CL| based :abbr:`LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL,
PHP)` web server you can skip ahead to the WordPress tutorial.

   This tutorial is for development and testing purposes only. Additional
