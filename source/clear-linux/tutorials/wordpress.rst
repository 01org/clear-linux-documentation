WordPress\* use case tutorial
#############################

Welcome to our WordPress use case tutorial. The objective of the tutorial is
to guide you to a fully realized WordPress website using |CLOSIA|.

In this tutorial we assume your system is already running |CL|. For
instructions on how to install |CL| on bare metal, see the
:ref:`bare metal install<bare-metal-install>` page from our
:ref:`getting started<getting-started>` guide. For your convenience, we have
split this tutorial in two different sections.  If you already have a |CL|
based :abbr:`LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)` web server you can skip ahead
to the WordPress tutorial.

   steps are required to secure production systems.
   Those steps are beyond the scope of this tutorial.
