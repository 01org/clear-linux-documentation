WordPress\* use case tutorial
#############################

Welcome to our WordPress\* use case tutorial. This tutorial describes the steps to 
setup a webserver to host a WordPress site using |CL-ATTR|.  

In this tutorial we assume your system is already running |CL|. For instructions 
on how to install |CL| on bare metal, see the :ref:`bare metal install<bare-metal-install>` 
page from our :ref:`get-started` guide. For your convenience, we have split this 
tutorial into two sections:  

#. Setting up a LAMP webserver with :ref:`web-server-install`.

#. Setting up Wordpress on a LAMP webserver with :ref:`wp-install`.

If you already have a |CL| based :abbr:`LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)` web server, 
you can skip ahead to the second section of this tutorial.

.. note::

   This tutorial is for development and testing purposes only. Additional steps 
   are required to secure production systems. Those steps are beyond the scope 
   of this tutorial.
