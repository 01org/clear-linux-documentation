WordPress\* use case tutorial
#############################

This tutorial describes how to setup a webserver to host a WordPress site using 
|CL-ATTR|. The tutorial is split into two sections:  

#. Setting up a LAMP webserver with :ref:`web-server-install`.

#. Setting up Wordpress on a LAMP webserver with :ref:`wp-install`.

If you already have a |CL| based :abbr:`LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)` web server, 
you can skip ahead to the second section of this tutorial.

.. note::

   This tutorial is for development and testing purposes only. Additional steps 
   are required to secure production systems. Those steps are beyond the scope 
   of this tutorial.
