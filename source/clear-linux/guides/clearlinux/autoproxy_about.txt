The |CL-ATTR| is the first Linux distribution to support autoproxy. The OS
can discover a Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) script and use it to automatically
resolve the proxy needed for a given connection. With Autoproxy, you can use
|CL| inside any proxy environment without having to manually
configure the proxies.

Corporate and private networks can be very complex, needing to restrict and
control network connections for security reasons. The typical side effects
are limited or blocked connectivity and requiring manual configuration of
proxies to perform the most mundane tasks such as cloning a repo or checking
for updates. With Clear Linux, all of the work is done behind the scenes to
effortlessly use your network and have connections “just work”.

This feature removes massive complications in network connectivity due to
proxy issues. You can automate tasks like unit testing without worrying
about the proxy not being set and you can remove unset proxies from the
equation when dealing with network unavailability across systems.

How Autoproxy works
-------------------

We designed autoproxy around general tools provided by nearly any Linux
distribution with a few minor additions and modifications. We leveraged the
DHCP and network information provided from systemd and created a
PAC-discovery daemon. The daemon uses the information to resolve a URL for a
PAC file. The daemon then passes the URL into PACrunner*. PACrunner
downloads the PAC file and uses the newly implemented Duktape* engine to
parse it.

From that point on, any cURL* or network requests query PACrunner for the
correct proxy to use. We modified the cURL library to communicate with
PACrunner over DBus. However, cURL will ignore PACrunner and run normally if
no PAC file is loaded or if you set any proxies manually. Thus, your
environment settings are respected and no time is wasted trying to resolve a
proxy.

More importantly: all these steps happen in the background, very quickly, and
with no user interaction.
