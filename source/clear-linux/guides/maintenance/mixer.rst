Use mixer tool
##############

*Mixing* refers to composing an operating system for specific use cases.
While the default Clear Linux* OS for IntelÂ® Architecture provides options
to install bundles for various server capabilities, some developers may wish
to either augment the operating system itself with functionality from their
own packages, or modify the structure of current bundles to cater to their
particular  needs.

Prerequisites
*************

To start working with the mixer tools, you'll need a recent image of Clear
Linux OS for Intel Architecture with the following bundle installed. If you
don't have it already, you can add it with the :command:`swupd bundle-add`
command like so:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # swupd bundle-add mixer

Current mixing workflow
***********************

#. **Create a workspace**. Create an empty directory in your Clear image to
   use as a "workspace" for mixing. For these steps, we assume your workspace
   location is :file:`/home/clr/mix`.

#. **Generate the starting point for your mix**. In your workspace, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # sudo mixer init --clear-version 13180 --mix-version 10

   This initializes your workspace so that you can make a mix at version 10
   based on upstream Clear Linux version 13180. A default :file:`builder.conf`
   file will be created (if one is not already present in your workspace)
   along with a :file:`mix-bundles` directory.

   If you intend to build a mix with your own custom RPMs, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # sudo mixer init --clear-version 13180 --mix-version 10 --local-rpms

   This creates :file:`local` and :file:`rpms` directories in your mix, and
   adds their paths to the generated :file:`builder.conf`. (For more
   information on using these directories, or setting them up manually, see
   Step 4 below.)

   You can easily build a mix that includes all Clear bundles with no
   modifications using the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # sudo mixer init --clear-version 13180 --mix-version 10 --all

#. **Configure builder.conf**. Edit the :file:`builder.conf` as needed.

   The :file:`builder.conf` file will be read automatically from the current
   workspace directory, but the :option:`--config` option exists to specify
   where the file is if you want to store it elsewhere.

   Note there are different sections of :file:`builder.conf`. The
   ``[Builder]`` section provides the mixer tools with the required
   configuration options, and defines where generated bundles and updated
   metadata should be published. The ``[swupd]`` section is used by
   swupd-server to create an update with specific update parameters.

   Edit the template configuration file according to your needs. For this
   example, your :file:`builder.conf` should look similar to the example
   below, with both URL variables set to the domain or IP of the update
   server:

   .. code-block:: console

      # vim /etc/bundle-chroot-builder/builder.conf:

      [Builder]
      SERVER_STATE_DIR=/home/clr/mix/update
      BUNDLE_DIR=/home/clr/mix/mix-bundles
      YUM_CONF=/home/clr/mix/.yum-mix.conf
      CERT=/home/clr/mix/Swupd_Root.pem
      VERSIONS_PATH=/home/clr/mix/

      [swupd]
      BUNDLE=os-core-update
      CONTENTURL=<URL where the content will be hosted>
      VERSIONURL=<URL where the version of the mix will be hosted>
      FORMAT=1

   The ``SERVER_STATE_DIR`` is where the mixed content is output. This
   is automatically created for you by the mixer. You can set this
   directory to any location, but we will use the workspace directory for
   this example. The same applies for ``BUNDLE_DIR``. This directory is
   generated for you in the location specified in the :file:`builder.conf`,
   in this case ``/home/clr/mix/mix-bundles``. This is where the bundle
   definitions are stored for your mix, and it is where the chroot-builder
   looks to know what bundles must be installed.

   The :file:`.yum-mix.conf` file defined in ``YUM_CONF`` is auto-generated,
   along with the ``CERT`` file, :file:`Swupd_Root.pem`. The yum configuration
   file is needed for the chroot-builder to know where the RPMs are hosted,
   and the certificate file is needed to sign the root Manifest to provide
   security for content verification.

   You can change the ``CERT=/path/to/cert`` line to point to a different
   certificate. The chroot builder inserts the certificate specified here
   in ``/os-core-update/usr/share/clear/update-ca/``. This is the certificate
   used by the software update client to verify the :file:`Manifest.MoM`
   signature. For now, we *highly* recommend that you do not modify this
   line, as the certificate that swupd expects needs a very specific
   configuration to sign and verify properly. The certificate is
   automatically generated, and the :file:`Manifest.MoM` is signed
   automatically as well, providing security for the updated content that
   you create.

   The ``CONTENTURL`` and ``VERSIONURL`` should be set to the domain or IP
   address where your updated content will be served. This is the location
   that hosts the :file:`/home/clr/mix/update/www` (``SERVER_STATE_DIR``)
   directory. Creating a symlink to the directory in your server webdir is
   an easy way to host the content. These URLs are embeded in images created
   for your mix. They are where ``swupd-client`` will look to figure out if
   there is a new version available, and the location from which to download
   the updated content. Think of these as the equivalent of the `Clear   Linux update page`_ used by Clear Linux, but for your derivative mix.

   To learn more about the ``FORMAT`` option, refer to the "Format Version"
   section at the bottom of this document, and `Format Bumps`_ on the Clear
   Linux wiki. For now, leave the ``FORMAT`` value alone and do not increment
   it.

   The mix version and Clear version will come from two state files:
   :file:`.mixversion` and :file:`.clearversion`, both of which will be
   created for you when you set up the workspace. They will be created in the
   directory defined by the ``VERSIONS_PATH``.

.. _step-four:

#. **Create/locate RPMs for mix.**. (Steps 4 through 6 are necessary only
   if you want to add your own RPMs to the Mix. If you are working only with Clear bundles, then skip to Step 7.)

   If you are creating RPMs from scratch, you can use ``autospec``, ``mock``,
   ``rpmbuild``, etc. to build them. If they are not built on Clear,
   make sure your configuration and toolchain builds them correctly for Clear, or there is no guarantee they will be compatible.

#. **Import RPMs into workspace**. Create an :file:`rpms` directory in your
   workspace (for example :file:`/home/clr/mix/rpms`), and copy the RPMs you
   want into that directory. Next, add the following to your
   :file:`builder.conf`:

   .. code-block:: bash

      RPMDIR=/home/clr/mix/rpms

   Mixer will look in this directory for RPMs to build a local RPM repo for
   yum to use.

#. **Create a local RPM repo**. Create an empty directory in your workspace
   named :file:`local` and add the path in your :file:`builder.conf`:

   .. code-block:: bash

      REPODIR=/home/clr/mix/local

   Once these values are configured, you can generate the yum repo by
   running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # sudo mixer add-rpms

   After the tool exits, you should see your RPMs and a repodata directory in
   :file:`/home/clr/mix/local`. If the RPMs are not all in this :file:`local`
   directory, check to make sure that they are indeed valid RPM files and not
   corrupt.

#. **Update/Add bundle definitions**. You can easily add bundles to your mix
   by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # sudo mixer bundle add bundle1,bundle2,...

   This command copies the specified bundle defintion files from your
   configured upstream version of Clear Linux (:file:`.clearversion`) into
   your :file:`mix-bundles` directory.

   Behind the scenes, mixer uses a local cache of the upstream Clear Linux
   bundle definitions. These are stored in the 
   :file:`.mixer/upstream-bundles/clr-bundles-{VER}/bundles/` directory in
   your workspace. Do *not* modify things in this directory; it is simply a
   mirror for the tool to use. However, you can refer to the files in this directory to see what bundles are available, or the format these files should have.

   To define your bundles:

      #. Navigate to the :file:`mix-bundles/` directory.
      #. Make any needed modifications to the bundle set.
      #. Commit the result:

      .. code-block:: bash

         $ git add .
         $ git commit -s -m 'Update bundles for mix #<VER>'

   While using Git is optional, with Git history, mixes are easy to revert
   or refer to in the future if something goes wrong with a new mix. If
   you're just testing this out, or if you really do not want to mess with
   Git, you can ignore committing for now.

   To add your own bundle, create a bundle definition file in the correct
   format in the :file:`mix-bundles` directory (you can refer to an existing
   bundle, like :file:`mix-bundles/os-core-update`, for formatting). Be sure that the bundle name you choose does not conflict with another bundle.
   Add your package name(s) in the bundle definition file to tell it what package(s) must be installed as part of that bundle.

#. **Build the bundle chroots**. To build all of the ``chroots`` that are
   based on the bundles you defined, run the following command in your
   workspace:

   .. code-block:: bash

    # sudo mixer build chroots

   If you have many bundles defined for your mix, this step might take some
   time.

#. **Create update**. In the workspace, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

    # sudo mixer build update

   When the build completes, you will find your mix update content under
   :file:`/home/clr/mix/update/www/VER`. In our example, this will be
   located in :file:`/home/clr/mix/update/www/{<MIXVERSION>}`, where
   ``<MIXVERSION>`` is the mix version you defined (10 by default).

   All content to make a fully usable mix will be created by this step, but
   note that only *zero packs* are automatically generated. Zero packs are
   the content needed to go from nothing to the mix version you just built
   content for. To create optional *delta packs*, which allow for
   transitioning from one mix version to another, run the pack-maker as
   follows:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # sudo mixer-pack-maker.sh --to <MIX_VERSION> --from <PAST_VERSION> -S /home/clr/mix/update

   The pack-maker will generate all delta packs for bundles that have changed
   from ``PAST_VERSION`` to ``MIX_VERSION``. If your ``STATE_DIR`` is in a
   different location, be sure to specify the location with the ``-S``
   option. For the first build, no delta packs can be created because the
   "update" is from version 0. Version 0 impicitly has no content, thus no
   deltas can be generated. For subsequent builds,
   :file:`mixer-pack-maker.sh` can be run to generate delta content between
   them (for example: 10 to 20).

#. **Creating an image**. Mixer uses the ``ister`` tool to create a bootable
   image from your updated content. To configure the image ``ister`` creates,
   you will need the ``ister`` config file. You can obtain a default value
   from the ``ister`` package:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # cp /usr/share/defaults/ister/ister.json relase-image-config.json

   For reference, you can inspect the ``ister`` config file that `Clear
   Linux uses`_ for its releases. 

   Note that mixer automatically looks for a file named :file:`release-image-
   config.json`, but you can choose whatever name you want. To use a
   different name, simply pass the :option:`--template path/to/file.config`
   flag when creating your image.

   Edit the config file to include all bundles that you want *preinstalled*
   into your image. The rest of the bundles in your mix will be available to your users via:

   .. code-block:: bash 

      # swupd bundle add 

   Keeping this list small allows for a smaller image size. For a minimal,
   base image, this list would be:

      .. code-block:: console

      "Bundles": ["os-core", "os-core-update", "kernel-native"]

   Next, set the ``Version`` field to the mix version content that the image
   should be built from. ``ister`` allows you to build an image from any mix
   version that you have built, not just the current one. For the first build
   example we've been using, ``Version`` would be set to 10.

   Finally, to build the image, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # sudo mixer build image --format 1

   The output from this should be an image that is bootable as a virtual
   machine and can be installed on bare metal.

   .. note::
      By default, ``ister`` uses the format version of the build machine it
      is running on. Therefore, if the format you are building is different
      than the format of the Clear Linux OS that you are building on, you
      need to pass :option:`--format <FORMAT_NUMBER>`. You can find your
      current format version by running:

      .. code-block:: bash

         # cat /usr/share/defaults/swupd/format

Creating your next mix version
==============================

**Update the next Mix version info**. Update the :file:`.mixversion` file to
the next version number you want to build.

From this point you can iterate through the instructions , starting again at
:ref:`step 4 <step-four>` and making modifications as needed. For example:

   - Add/remove/modify bundles
   - ``sudo mixer build chroots``
   - ``sudo mixer build update``
   - (Optionally) ``sudo mixer-pack-maker.sh --to <NEWVERSION> --from <PREV_VERSION> -S /home/clr/mix/update``


Format Version
**************

The ``format`` used in :file:`builder.conf` might be more precisely referred
to as an OS "compatibility epoch". Versions of the OS within a given epoch
are fully compatible with themselves and can update to any version in that
epoch. Across the ``format`` boundary *something* has changed in the OS,
such that updating from build M in format X, to build N in format Y will not
work. Generally this occurs when the software updater or manifests changed 
in a way that is no longer compatible with the previous update scheme.

A format increment is the way we insure pre- and co-requisite changes flow
out with proper ordering. The updated client will only ever update to the
latest release in its respective format version (unless overridden by
command line flags). Thus we can guarantee all clients will update to the
final version in their given format, which *must* contain all the changes
needed to understand the content built in the subsequent format. Only after
reaching the final release in the old format will a client be able to
continue to update to releases in the new format.

When creating a custom mix, the format version should start at '1', or
some known number, and should increment only when a compatibility breakage is
introduced. Normal updates (for example, updating a software package) do not
require a format increment.
