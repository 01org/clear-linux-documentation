Contribution guidelines
***********************

We welcome contributions and we ask you to follow our guidelines for
consistent, readable documentation.

The |CL| documentation is hosted in GitHub and is written using
reStructuredText. These guidelines provide examples, templates, and best
practices for your contributions.

Before contributing
===================

If you haven't contributed before, review the following items:

*   GitHub `documentation repository`_ shows our document organization.
*   :ref:`writing-guide` describes the style we use to keep our documents clear
    and concise.
*   :ref:`structure-formatting` provides details on how we use reStructuredText
    and Sphinx in our documents.

How to contribute
=================

There are multiple ways to contribute and help improve our documentation:

* **Make a suggestion**: Have a documentation suggestion but no time to write it
  yourself? Send your suggestion to the `mailing list`_ at: dev@lists.clearlinux.org.
* **Log an issue**: If you find a problem in our documentation (such as typos or out-of-date
  information), log an issue in the `documentation repository`_.
* **Contribute directly via GitHub**: Whether you've found a typo, have better
  instructions or examples, or have a new page to add, submit your improvement or
  addition as a pull request on the `documentation repository`_.
* **Test documentation**: Step through our instructional guides and tutorials to
  verify the instructions. Log or correct any out-of-date information.

All contributions must follow our `code of conduct`_.
