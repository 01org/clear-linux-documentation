Code of conduct
###############

The |CLOSIA| community is made up of a mixture of professionals and
volunteers from all over the world. We strongly believe diversity is our
strength and want to promote an inclusive and safe environment.

To that end, we have a few ground rules for engaging in the community. The
following code of conduct applies equally to all community participants,
including project team leads, core contributors, mentors, users,
participants, and those seeking help and guidance.

This code of conduct also applies to all spaces the project manages or
authorizes, including IRC channels, the mailing lists, issue trackers,
sponsored events, and any other forums the community uses and the project
manages. In addition, violations of this code of conduct outside of these
venues may affect a person's ability to participate within them after
appropriate investigation.

**Be friendly, patient, and welcoming.** We strive to be a community that
welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This
includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture,
national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class,
educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression,
age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical
ability.

**Be considerate.** Our work will be used by other people and we, in turn,
will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and
colleagues. We should take those consequences into account when making
decisions. Remember, we are a world-wide community and we have a global base
of users and contributors. Even if it is not obvious at the time, our
contributions to the |CL| project will impact the work of others.

**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time but disagreement is
no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
frustration now and then but we cannot allow frustration to turn into a
personal attack. Remember, a community where people feel uncomfortable or
threatened is not productive. Members of the |CL| community should be
respectful when dealing with other contributors, people outside of the
project, and users.

**Collaborate openly.** Collaboration is central to the |CL| project and to
the larger free software community. This collaboration involves individuals
working within teams and working with other projects outside of the |CL|
community. This collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of
our work. Internally and externally, we should always be open to
collaboration. Wherever possible, we should work closely with upstream and
downstream projects and others in the free software community to coordinate
our technical, advocacy, documentation, and other work. Our work should be
done transparently and we should involve as many interested parties as early
as possible. If we decide to take a different approach, we will let them know
early, document our work, and inform others regularly of our progress. Do not
create private forms of communication that take away transparency or exclude
other contributors and collaborators.

**When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time and the |CL| community is no exception.
Resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember, we are
different. The strength of the community comes from its diversity: people
from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different
perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a
viewpoint does not mean they are wrong. Focus on helping resolve issues and
learning from mistakes. Resolve disagreements and differing views
constructively and with the help of the community and community processes.

**When unsure, ask for help.** Nobody knows everything and nobody
is expected to be perfect in the |CL| community. Asking questions avoids many
problems down the road. So, questions are encouraged. If you are asked
questions, be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, take
care to do it in an appropriate forum such as the `mailing list`_ or the
#clearlinux `IRC channel`_.

**Be careful with your words and actions.** We are a community of
professionals and we conduct ourselves professionally. Do not insult or put
down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior is not
acceptable and should be reported. This includes but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually suggestive, explicit, or violent material.
* Posting, or threatening to post, other people's personally identifying
  information, AKA "`doxing`_".
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
  then stop.
