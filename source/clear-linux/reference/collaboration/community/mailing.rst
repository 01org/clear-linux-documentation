Mailing list guidelines
=======================

These guidelines apply for all emails written to dev@lists.clearlinux.org.
They ensure communication remains civil, productive, and brief. Use the
`mailing list`_ effectively and get as much feedback as possible on your
work.

* Use the mailing list as much as possible. Specifically, use the mailing
  list to:

   + Submit :abbr:`RFCs(Requests for Comments)` on planned contributions.
   + Submit bugs for the team to address. See :ref:`bug-report`.
   + Ask questions about the |CLOSIA|.
   + Collaborate with developers on new features.

* Provide a meaningful subject line.

* Ask your questions directly to the subject matter experts and
  add the mailing list in CC.

* Before doing large amounts of work, send a message detailing your planned
  changes to the mailing list as a RFC. Thus, you will save time by only
  working on solutions the community will find useful.

* Write briefly and to the point while giving enough context. Keep in mind
  your message should be clear without readers re-creating your thought
  process or having to review the same amount of content as you have.

* Be measured but persistent if you are not getting a response.

* Write individual emails for each work item. If they are connected, say so
  in each email.

* Do not rehash old issues.

* Only reply if you can provide new information, a new perspective, or a
  decision. Avoid "me-too" posts.

* When replying in-line to a mail that was CC'ed to the list, trim out
  unnecessary context between replies and at the end of your mail.

* When submitting bugs, include the steps needed to recreate the issue and
  any relevant information about the system. Use our bug reporting template.
  See :ref:`bug-report`.

* Do not use capital letters to emphasize a point.

* Make sure your lines are between 72 to 76 characters long.
