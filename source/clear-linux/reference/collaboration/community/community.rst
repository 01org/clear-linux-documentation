Community tools
###############

Open source is about sharing as much information as possible about your
development. Maintainers and contributors must communicate effectively with
each other to build a development community. |CLOSIA| uses typical open
source collaboration tools: a mailing list, an IRC channel, and GitHub. We
strive to be open about our work with the entire community.

In this spirit, do not send private feedback through email. Instead,
send feedback to the mailing list by hitting 'Reply-to-all'
and by keeping the CC list intact.

The following sections contain information about the communication tools
the |CL| project uses.
