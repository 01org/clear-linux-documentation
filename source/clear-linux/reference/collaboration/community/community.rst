Welcome to the Clear Linux community
####################################

Open source is about sharing as much information as possible about your
development. Maintainers and contributors must communicate effectively with
each other to build a development community. |CLOSIA| uses typical open
source collaboration tools: a mailing list, an IRC channel, and GitHub. We
strive to be open about our work with the entire community.

These tools provide you with different options to engage and participate with
the community. As with any tool, the community tools each serve a specific
purpose. The following sections explain the ideal use of the tools. However,
feel free to engage using the tool you feel most comfortable with.
