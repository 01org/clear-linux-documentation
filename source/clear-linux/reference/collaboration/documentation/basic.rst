Basic writing guide
###################

For your convenience, we have complied this list of basic rules. These rules
apply to every document, in-code comment, commit message, or note. You can
find more detailed information in our :ref:`language` or in the other
referenced sections.

* Limit line length to 78 characters. This is due to the limitations
  of the review system.

* Remove trailing white space from your documents.

* Short sentences and paragraphs. Keep sentence length down to about
  20 words.

* Include only one main idea in a sentence. See :ref:`simple`.

* Limit the number of clauses you use to no more than two. See :ref:`simple`.

* Limit the number of sentences per paragraph to about six. See :ref:`simple`.

* Use strong verbs. See :ref:`simple`.

* Use action verbs. See :ref:`simple`.

* Avoid weak verbs like be, have, make, and do. See :ref:`simple`.

* Use short direct commands and avoid niceties such as the word
  "please".

* Use the present tense wherever possible and avoid past and future
  tense verbs. See :ref:`simple`.

* Use Active voice. Write, "Someone does something"; don't write,
  "Something is done by someone" or "Something is done." See :ref:`simple`.

* Use "we" for recommendations. Write "We recommend..." as opposed to
  "It is recommended...." See :ref:`simple`.

* Use "you" rather than "the user" in your instructions.

* Use short common English words whenever possible, see our :ref:`simple`
  guide.

* Avoid contractions. See :ref:`grammar`.

* Use parallelism in headings, sentences, and lists, see our
  :ref:`parallelism` guide.

* Put conditional phrases first in cautions and warnings. For example:
  "If you do X, then Y will occur." See our :ref:`notices` guide.

* Limit headings to three levels. Avoid heading levels beyond H3. If you have
  fourth, fifth, or sixth level headings, rewrite the information in these
  sections or split the content in multiple files and sections.

* To reduce ambiguity, use articles such as 'a', 'an', and 'the'
  whenever possible.

* If you abbreviate codenames, use a substitution. For example: \|CL\| is
  defined in the :file:`/substitutions.rst` to be replaced by "Clear Linux".

* Place figures and tables immediately after related text.

* Place code immediately after the leading text in a new line, see our
  :ref:`code`.

* Use the appropriate reference format to refer to figures, code and
  tables specifically: Use "Figure X," instead of "The figure above or below"
  whenever possible. See :ref:`cross` and :ref:`images`.

* Avoid inserting any table or figure without having at least one
  direct reference to it in the body text. See :ref:`tables`.
