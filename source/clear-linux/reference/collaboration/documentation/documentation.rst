Documentation contribution guidelines
#####################################

The |CLOSIA| documentation contribution guidelines provide detailed information
about the scope and purpose of the documentation, the accepted writing style,
and the markup used.

This guide provides rules to write :ref:`clear, concise<basic>`, and
:ref:`consistent content<structures>`. Our documentation is written using
Restructuredtext and we provide
:ref:`examples, templates, and best practices<rest>` for that markup.

The |CL| technical content is written in Simple American English and our
:ref:`language` contains detailed information on that standard.

This guide includes the following sections:

   :maxdepth: 2

   language


Scope
*****

The |CL| documentation is dived in five sections:

* **Get started:** Information about installing Clear Linux.
* **Concepts:** Detailed technical information about our features.
* **Guides:** Step-by-step instructions to complete common tasks and
  configuration.
* **Tutorials:** Step-by-step instructions to complete the installation and
  configuration of the tools needed for a specific use case.
* **Reference:** Information providing additional context or details.

If you are unsure on which section to use for your contribution, send an
email to our `mailing list`_ at: dev@lists.clearlinux.org Include the outline
of the contribution you are planning and a brief description of its intended
purpose and scope.

This style guide applies to the following technical documents:

* Commit messages.
* Technical presentations.
* All documents in Restructuredtext within and without the documentation
  repository.
* In-code comments.
* Release notes.

We are always grateful to receive content contributions and are happy to help
via our mailing list or our IRC channel, #clearlinux. If you have found a
problem with one of our documents, please file a bug report. Use our
:ref:`bug-report` to submit the bug to our mailing list.

Tone and audience
*****************

The tone of the |CL| documentation should be clear, concise, confident, and
courteous. We are writing to peers, so we want to be familiar. Use you, we,
and avoid the passive voice but remain professional. The writing should carry
an undertone of cordiality, respect, and cooperation.

Assume your audience has about the same level of technical understanding and
expertise as you had when you first started. We don't want to talk down to
our readers but do not assume the readers know everything about the subject.
Offer brief explanations or summaries of "common knowledge" where a
significant portion of readers might benefit.

Methodology
***********

The :ref:`documentation` contains exceptions to other style guides. It also
contains additional material not found in those sources.

To research a style question, look for the answer in the :ref:`documentation`
first. If the question is not answered there, send your question to the
`mailing list`_ at: dev@lists.clearlinux.org. For hyphenation, spelling, or
terminology usage questions, look in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate
Dictionary.

If the question is answered in the existing style guide or dictionary,
the solution is implemented and enforced as described.

  Chicago Press;

do we always agree with these sources. In areas where there is
disagreement, the decisions made may be explained within the respective
section.

This guide takes precedence over all other style guides in all
cases. In cases where the guide does not address the issue at hand, the
issue must be reported to the `mailing list`_ using our :ref:`bug-report`.
