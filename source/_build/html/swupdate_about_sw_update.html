<h1>About software update</h1>
<div class="section" id="the-traditional-way">
<h2>The traditional way</h2>
<p>Traditional Linux-based operating systems are often a mix of several
hundred, if not thousands, of open source projects. To make them
manageable, most distributions use the concept of &#8220;packages&#8221; to configure
and compile source code into binaries for installation.</p>
<p>Many distributions then combine these compiled binaries into so-called
packages, resolving dependencies and providing everything needed to
install. This is the granularity at which typical distributions deploy
their software, enabling system administrators to install and update
each package individually or as a set, using tools such as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">yum</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">apt-get</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-clear-way">
<h2>The Clear way</h2>
<p>Clear Linux OS for IntelÂ® Architecture does things a little differently.
Following here are a few notable features that distinguish it from
standard OSes: bundles, versioning, updating, and update speed.</p>
<div class="section" id="bundles">
<h3>Bundles</h3>
<p>While we use the concept of packages to manage compiling source code into
installable binaries, we do not deploy software through packages. Instead,
we provide &#8220;bundles&#8221; which operate as a self-contained set of functionality
for the system administrator &#8211; functionality that gets enabled by composing
all the required upstream open-source projects into one logical unit: a
bundle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="versioning">
<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p>On a traditional distribution, the process of describing current software
versioning usually involves:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Listing and keeping track of the current OS release (generally
uninformative about any singular packages or functionality),</li>
<li>Keeping track of packages and repositories being used, updating them
individually,</li>
<li>Listing and tracking every package available and installed on the
system, none of which are directly tied to the current OS release</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be done effectively, but given the nearly endless combinations of
packages and versions of packages a server may have, it quickly becomes
non-trivial to define what &#8220;version&#8221; the system is and what software it
is running without explicitly going through each system and inspecting
every package.</p>
<p>With the Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture, we need only track:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>One single number</li>
</ul>
<p>A number representing the <strong>current</strong> release of the OS is sufficient to
describe the versions of all the software on the OS. Each build is
composed of a specific set of bundles made from a particular version of
packages. This matters on a daily basis to system administrators, who
need to determine which of their systems do not have the latest security
fixes, or which combinations of software have been tested, and on what
other pieces. Every release of the same number is guaranteed to contain
the same versions of software, so there&#8217;s no ambiguity between two
systems running the same Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating">
<h3>Updating</h3>
<p>Another notable difference between package-based distributions and Clear Linux
is how updates are managed. On a package-based OS, system administrators update
each individual package or piece of software to a newer (or older!) version. With
Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture, an update translates to an entirely new
OS version, containing one or many updates.  It is not possible to update a
piece of the system while remaining on the same version of Clear Linux.</p>
<p>How is this useful? Although it seems, at first, like a huge restriction
or limitation, this method has many non-obvious benefits. Imagine a
cloud environment composed of numerous machines.  Here, a homogeneous set of
software makes sense &#8211; from the system administrator&#8217;s level down to the
user level. Homogeneous systems allow users the ability to focus on their
contributions and/or code, rather than configuring environments or worrying
about synchronizing versions and updates.  At the system admin level, it
ensures security is tighter and makes it far easier to monitor and update
patches.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="update-speed">
<h3>Update speed</h3>
<p>Software updates with Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture are also
efficient. Bundles simply describe a set of files, and the update
technology updates <em>only</em> files that actually changed by using so-called
binary-delta technology for efficiency <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>. Operating systems that use
packages as the unit of deployment require full package updates (thus
hogging resources), even when one small file in that package has changed.</p>
<p>It is quite common for a full OS update fixing a security hole to be
only 15 kilobytes in total update size. If only several kilobytes need
to be changed, it does not make sense to re-download and reinstall an
entire package or suite of programs just to incorporate a minuscule (yet
important) update. Through binary deltas, the OS is able to update only
those bits that changed, yielding very small update content (deltas)
that can be applied exceedingly fast.  As a result, major security patches
and core update take merely seconds.</p>
<p>We realize that while our definition of bundles makes sense to us, each
data center operator may have special needs and ideas. For that reason
we&#8217;re hard at work on a &#8220;mixer&#8221; tool, which allows users of Clear Linux OS
for Intel Architecture the ability to customize and add bundles and
their own software while keeping the content of the operating
system, and its updates, as the base. With this tool, system administrators
can focus on the pieces of their OS deployment that are custom to their
environment, while continuing to stay on a controlled update stream.</p>
