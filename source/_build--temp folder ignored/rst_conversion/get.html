<p><span>Linux*-based operating systems contain the code of several hundred, if not thousands, of open source projects. To make this manageable, distributions use a concept called "packages" to configure and compile the source code of these projects into binaries, which can then be logically installed.</span></p>
<p><span>Many distributions then combine these compiled binaries into so-called packages, resolving dependencies and providing everything needed to install. This is the granularity at which typical distributions deploy their software, enabling system administrators to install and update each package individually or as a set, using tools such as "yum" and "apt-get."</span></p>
<h2><span>The Clear way</span></h2>
<p><span>The Clear Linux OS for Intel</span><span>(r)</span><span> Architecture does things a bit differently. While we use the concept of packages to manage compiling source code into installable binaries, we do not deploy software through packages as many distributions do. Instead, we provide "bundles" that each contain a set of functionality for the system administrator--functionality that is enabled by composing all the required upstream open source projects into one logical unit: a bundle.</span></p>
<p><span>There is another notable difference between package-based distributions and the Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture. On a package-based OS, a system administrator can update each individual package or piece of software to a newer (or older!) version. In the Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture, an update translates to an entirely new OS version, containing one or many updates; it is not possible to update a piece of the system while remaining on the same version of Clear Linux.</span></p>
<p><span>Why would you want this? This may sound like a huge restriction or limitation at first, but we consider this a great feature. Imagine a cloud environment with many machines. In this case, it is desirable and more advantageous to have a homogeneous set of software.</span></p>
<p><span>With traditional distributions, to describe what version of software a server is running, one might need to:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><span>List and keep track of the current OS release (generally uninformative about any singular packages or functionality) </span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span>Keep track of all packages and repositories used, updating those as required to keep up to date</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span>List and keep track of every package available and installed on the system, none of which are directly tied to the current OS release</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><span>This is done very well, but given the nearly endless combinations of packages and </span><span>versions</span><span> of packages a server may have, it quickly becomes non-trivial to define what "version" the </span><span>system</span><span> is and what software it is running without explicitly going through each system and inspecting every package.</span></p>
<p><span>With the Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture, we must keep track of:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><span>One single number</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><span>That number represents the current OS release, and it is sufficient to describe the versions of all the software on the OS. Each build is composed of a specific set of bundles made from a particular version of packages. This matters on a daily basis to system administrators, who need to determine which of their systems do not have the latest security fixes, or which combinations of software have been tested with which other pieces. Every release of the same number is guaranteed to contain the same versions of software, so there is no ambiguity between two systems running the same Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture. </span></p>
<h2><span>Incredible update speeds</span></h2>
<p><span>Software updates with Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture are also efficient; bundles are only describing a set of files, and the update technology only updates files that actually changed, using so-called binary-delta technology for efficiency. Updating using this method is different from operating systems that use packages as the unit of deployment. In those operating systems, the entire package gets updated when needed, even if only one small file in that package has changed.</span></p>
<p><span>It is quite common for a full OS update fixing a security hole to be only 15 kilobytes in total update size. If only several kilobytes need to be changed, it does not make sense to re-download and reinstall an entire package or suite of programs just to incorporate a miniscule (yet important) update. Through binary deltas, the OS is able to update only those bits that changed, yielding very small update content (deltas) that can be applied exceedingly fast. One can then expect a major security patch or core update to take seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>We realize that while our definition of bundles makes sense to us, each data center operator may have special needs and ideas. For that reason we are working on completing a "mixer" tool, which would allow users of Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture to customize and add bundles and their own software while still using the content of the operating system, and its updates, as the base. This way system administrators can focus on the pieces of their OS deployment that are custom to their environment, while continuing to stay on a controlled update stream.</span></p>
