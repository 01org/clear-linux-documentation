"This approach forks away from the |CL| upstream and has you act as your "

"An Infrastructure OS can design for good behavior, but it is ultimately "

msgstr ""

"The application architecture should incorporate an appropriate tolerance "

"drift, challenges your monitoring systems, and business continuity plans."
