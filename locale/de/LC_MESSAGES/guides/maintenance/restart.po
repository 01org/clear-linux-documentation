"|CL-ATTR| includes a :command:`clr-service-restart` tool that shows which"

":command:`clr-service-restart` reads various files in the :file:`procfs` "

":command:`clr-service-restart` implements a whitelist to identify which "
"daemons can be restarted. As a system administrator, you can customize "
"the default |CL| OS whitelist using :command:`allow` or "
":command:`disallow` options for restarting system services. When a "
"software update occurs, :command:`clr-service-restart` consults the "
"whitelist to see if a service daemon is allowed to be restarted or not."

":command:`clr-service-restart` has three basic options: :command:`allow`,"

msgid "allow"
msgstr ""

#: ../../guides/maintenance/restart.rst:43
msgid ""
"The :command:`allow` option identifies a daemon to restart after an OS "
"software update. The :command:`clr-service-restart` daemon creates a "
"symlink in :file:`/etc/clr-service-restart` as a record. The example "
"below tells :command:`clr-service-restart` to restart the *tallow* daemon"
" after an OS software update."

msgid "disallow"
msgstr ""

#: ../../guides/maintenance/restart.rst:56
msgid ""
"The :command:`disallow` option tells :command:`clr-service-restart` not "

" to be restarted. The :command:`clr-service-restart` daemon creates a "
"symlink in :file:`/etc/clr-service-restart` that points to "
":file:`/dev/null` as a record. The example below tells :command:`clr-"

"The :command:`default` option makes :command:`clr-service-restart` revert"
