"This tutorial walks you through the process of installing, configuring, "
"and running Apache Hadoop on |CL-ATTR|. The Apache Hadoop software "
"library is a framework for distributed processing of large data sets "
"across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is "
"designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, with "
"each machine offering local computation and storage."
