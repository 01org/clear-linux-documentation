msgstr ""

#: ../../tooling/swupd-guide.rst:26
msgid ""
":ref:`Bundles <bundles>` contain everything needed to deliver a software "
"capability. They are the smallest granularity component that is managed "
"by |CL|. A bundle comes with all of its dependencies rather than "
"downloading a cascade of package dependencies when installing a piece of "
"software."

msgid ""
"With |CL| :command:`swupd`, versioning happens at the individual file "
"level. This means |CL| generates an entirely new OS version with any set "
"of software changes to the system, including software downgrades or "
"removals. This rolling release versioning model is similar to "
":command:`git` internal version tracking, where any of the individual "
"file commits are tracked and move the pointer forward when changed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tooling/swupd-guide.rst:45
msgid ""
"A number that represents the **current** release of the OS describes the "
"versions of all the software on the OS. Each build is composed of a "
"specific set of bundles made from a particular version of packages. On a "
"daily basis, this matters to system administrators who need to determine "
"which of their systems do not have the latest security fixes, or which "
"combinations of software have been tested. Every release of the same "
"number is guaranteed to contain the same versions of software, so there's"
" no ambiguity between two systems running the same version of |CL|."

"|CL| enforces regular updating of the OS by default and automatically "
"checks for updates against a version server. The content server provides "
"the file and metadata content for all versions and can be the same as the"
" version server. The content url server provides metadata in the form of "
"*manifests*, which list and describe file contents, symlinks, and "
"directories. Additionally, the actual content is provided to clients in "
"the form of archive files."
msgstr ""

"Software updates with |CL| are also efficient. Unlike package-based "
"distributions, :command:`swupd` only updates files that have changed, "
"rather than entire packages. For example, it is quite common for an OS "
"security patch to be as small as 15 KB. Using binary deltas, |CL| is able"
" to apply only what is needed."
