"By default, |CL| installations have a machine generated name, which is a "
"long string of letters and numbers. The generated name is fine for "
"computers but is not human-friendly. Administrators and users will often "
"want to rename their machines with a name that is easier to remember, "
"type, and search for. Renaming a machine also makes it easier to "
"identify, by including meaningful data in the name.  The following "
"examples show human-friendly machine names:"
