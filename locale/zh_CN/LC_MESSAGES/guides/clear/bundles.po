"Linux-based operating systems contain the code of several hundred, if not"
" thousands, of open source projects. To make this manageable, "
"distributions use a concept called \"packages\" to configure and compile "
"the source code of these projects into binaries."
msgstr "基于 Linux 的操作系统包含数百甚至数千个开源项目的代码。为了便于管理，发行版使用了一个名为 \"packages\" 的概念来配置这些项目的源代码并将其编译成二进制代码。"

"Many distributions then split the content of these compiled packages into"
" so-called sub-packages, which are the granularity at which these "
"distributions deploy their software. With those kinds of distributions, "
"system administrators can then install and update sub-packages "
"individually or as a set, using tools such as \"yum\" and \"apt-get.\""
msgstr "许多发行版随后将这些编译包的内容分成所谓的子包，这些子包是这些发行版部署其软件的粒度。借助这些类型的发行版，系统管理员就可以使用 \"yum\" 和 \"apt-get.\" 等工具单独或按组安装和更新子包。"

"The |CL-ATTR| takes a slightly different approach. While we also use the "
"concept of packages to manage compiling source code into binaries, we do "
"not use the package concept to deploy software. Instead, we provide "
"software \"bundles\" that are installed and managed using :ref:`swupd"
"<swupd-guide>`. Each bundle contains as many or as few open source "
"projects needed to provide a complete functionality."
